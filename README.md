## Some helpful git scripts

This repository contains some useful scripts that I've picked up for doing fiddly/annoying `git` manipulation, mostly pulled in and adapted from various sources.

Currently it contains:

- `name-corrector.sh`, a shell script for changing the name and/or email of a contributor across all their commits.
